### Whiz's Tile!

I had initially created this little project as a fun puzzle I could send to my friends and have them try it out. I drew on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue to create this dynamic web page. While I did initially code the page in 3 files, I ended up combining them together to make it easier to download and run. 
If you download the full HTML file it contains all the code necessary to use the little puzzle I made, and I hope you enjoy!
